Among the many optimization trajectory techniques used in robotics, Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) has become successful thanks to its computational efficiency. The trajectory optimizer employed in this project is the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR), a variant of the classic DDP.
